the [Open Database License (ODbL) 1.0](https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/). The derived file is
rebuilt by `tools/geodata/` (`fetch.sh`, then `node tools/geodata/build.mjs`).

## Elevation data: `public/data/dem-*.bin`

## Libraries

The SMAA area and search lookup textures (`public/textures/smaa/`) are from three.js (MIT), which ships
them from J. Jimenez et al.'s SMAA reference implementation (MIT).

[Vite](https://vite.dev) (MIT) and [geotiff.js](https://geotiffjs.github.io/) (MIT, used only by the geodata
tool) are npm dependencies and are not vendored here.
