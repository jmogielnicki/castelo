// Shared world layout. Coordinates in metres, y up (metres above sea level, Copernicus DEM datum).
// x points east, z points south (north = -z), origin at the centre of the walls' bounding box
// (39.36158° N, 9.15721° W). The sun rises in the east (+x) and sets in the west (-x).
//
// Óbidos sits on a north-south limestone ridge: the castle at the north end, the main gate (Porta da
// Vila) near the south end, Rua Direita running between them. West of the walls the land falls to
// the flat Várzea (about 5 m); the long straight west wall looks over it toward the sunset.
